# Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning in Python

This project implements a solution for face mask detection using deep learning techniques. Developed in Python, it can be used to analyze images in real-time to verify if people are wearing face masks.

## Description
Face mask detection has become essential in many contexts to ensure public health and safety. This project proposes a method based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately identify the presence of face masks with high precision.
